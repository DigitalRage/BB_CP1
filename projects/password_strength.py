#Added re (RegEx) module in order to fit all possible outcomes in smaller area and to return true or false since re.search Returns a Match object if there is a match anywhere in the string https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_regex.asp

    #re.search Returns a Match object if there is a match anywhere in the string
    #(r) is used to make sure that \ is not used as an excape character by turining it into a raw strint, hence r = raw
