BB 1st Pseudocode Tic Tac Toe Project
    imported random module

    player_input is input from #1-9
    while the input doesn't equal #1-9 try again
    if successful convert player_input (which is a non-number at the moment) to a whole number

    computer_input is using random.randint() to get a random number from 1-9

    board will be 3*3 tile shaped, 1-3 for first row, 4-6 for second row, 7-9 for third row
     1 | 2 | 3
    -----------
     4 | 5 | 6
    -----------
     7 | 8 | 9 

    turn equals random.randint() (a random number) to import #0-1 randomly
    if 0 is the end result then the player goes first, otherwise if the result is 1 then the computer goes first
    after that it loops turn based
    
    numbers will be replaced be using .replace() (to replace content inside the text) on the inside of the board
    if it is computers turn use X as their placemark on the board
    if it is players turn use O as their placemark on the board
    if the spot is already used, display "try again" and loop the segment

    display the board after computer and players turns

    loop until all pieces on the board are filled or if 3 of the same character in a row column or diagonal

    p_win_var will be used to see if player has the right win requirements if 3 of the same character in a row column or diagonal
    c_win_var will be used to see if computer has the right win requirements if 3 of the same character in a row column or diagonal

    open_slots will be a list of #1-9
    if they all turn into non-numbers end the game
    if win requirements are fulfiled end the game

    if all board places are filled diplay "tie game"
    if the player won, display "the player won"
    if the computer won, display "the computer won"
